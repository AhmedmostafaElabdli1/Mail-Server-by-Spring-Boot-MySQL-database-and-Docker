# Implementation of a Mail Server Using Java Spring Boot with MySQL Database and Dockerization

## Introduction:
   The aim of this project is to develop a robust mail server using Java Spring Boot framework, incorporating a MySQL database for data persistence, and Docker for containerization. This report outlines the key components, architecture, and technologies utilized in the implementation of the project.

##  Technologies Used:
   - Java Spring Boot: A popular framework for building Java-based applications, providing features for rapid development and deployment.
   - MySQL Database: An open-source relational database management system, chosen for its reliability and performance in storing mail data.
   - Docker: A containerization platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.
   - Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, simplifying the management of interconnected services.

##  Project Architecture:
   - **Spring Boot Application**: The core of the project is developed using Java Spring Boot, providing RESTful endpoints for sending mails.
   - **MySQL Database**: Used for storing mail-related data such as sender, recipient, subject, and body.
   - **Docker Containers**: The entire application is containerized using Docker, ensuring portability and scalability.
   
##  Implementation Details:
   - **Mail Service**: Implemented using Spring Boot's `JavaMailSender` API, allowing the application to send emails programmatically.
   - **Database Schema**: Designed a relational database schema to store mail data efficiently, with appropriate indexing for quick retrieval.
   - **RESTful API**: Developed RESTful endpoints for sending mails, with support for specifying subject, body, sender, and recipient information.
   - **Dockerization**: Dockerized the Spring Boot application and MySQL database using Dockerfiles, and orchestrated them using Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling.
   
##  Project Workflow:
   - Upon receiving a request to send an email through the RESTful API, the Spring Boot application validates the input data.
   - The application then connects to the MySQL database to store the email details.
   - Using the JavaMailSender API, the application sends the email to the specified recipient(s).
   - Docker Compose ensures seamless integration and management of the application and database containers, enabling easy scaling and deployment.

##  Future Improvements:
   - Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the mail server.
   - Enhancing error handling and logging for better monitoring and debugging.
   - Adding support for attachments and HTML content in emails.
   - Implementing scheduled tasks for automatic email sending and processing.

##  Conclusion:
   The development of a mail server using Java Spring Boot, MySQL database, and Docker demonstrates an efficient and scalable solution for sending emails. By leveraging these technologies, the project ensures reliability, portability, and ease of deployment, laying a solid foundation for future enhancements and integrations.
